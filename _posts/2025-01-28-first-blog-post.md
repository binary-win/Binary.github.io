# Understanding Call Stack Spoofing in Malware Evasion  

## Introduction  
Call stack spoofing is an advanced technique used by malware to evade detection by EDRs. By manipulating the call stack, an attacker can hide malicious execution flow and bypass security hooks.  

## How It Works  
1. **Identifying Detection Points** – Security tools often rely on stack traces to detect malicious behavior.  
2. **Manipulating the Stack** – Attackers modify return addresses or create fake stack frames.  
3. **Executing Payloads Stealthily** – By spoofing the call stack, malware can make its execution appear benign.  

## Real-World Application  
A common approach is **return address hijacking**, where the attacker replaces return addresses to redirect execution without triggering EDR alerts.  

## Conclusion  
Call stack spoofing is a powerful evasion method, but it requires a deep understanding of Windows internals. Future posts will explore synthetic stack frame construction for more advanced evasion.  

Stay tuned for a hands-on implementation!
