# About Me  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I spend an unreasonable amount of time battling security defenses, reverse engineering malware, and questioning why Windows has so many APIs.  

I’m [Your Name], a security researcher with a passion for **malware analysis, reverse engineering, and EDR evasion**. While some people enjoy relaxing hobbies, I prefer dissecting malicious code, bypassing security mechanisms, and exploring how attackers outsmart defenders—because, let’s be honest, it’s way more fun.  

My journey started with a simple curiosity: *How do hackers break into systems, and how can they be stopped?* That curiosity quickly turned into a full-blown obsession with **Windows internals, adversary tactics, and offensive security research**. Now, I spend my time exploring **APT techniques, developing evasion methods, and analyzing malware behavior in depth**.  

When I’m not knee-deep in disassembly, you’ll find me sharing my discoveries—whether it's **technical deep dives, proof-of-concept exploits, or sarcastic commentary on bad security practices**. If you enjoy **malware research, Windows hacking, and pushing the limits of cybersecurity**, you’re in the right place.  

Stick around. It’s going to be a wild ride.
